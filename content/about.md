I am a postdoc researcher in the Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation at the University of FLorida, working with [Ben Baiser](http://www.wec.ufl.edu/faculty/baiser).

I am broadly interested in community ecology, global change ecology, and the causes and consequences of biodiversity. I am getting more interested in ecological modelling and computational ecology recently.

My thesis study is about long-term dynamics of taxonomic, functional trait and phylogenetic dynamics of central sand plain pine barrens communities in Wisconsin (1958-2012).

I like watching movies and sports games, listening musics, hiking, photographing, etc.

I like it when people say hi!
